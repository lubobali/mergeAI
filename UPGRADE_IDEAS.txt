MergeAI — Upgrade Ideas to WIN the Hackathon
======================================================================
Deadline: Tuesday Feb 25, 11:59 PM PST
Current score: 100/100 (AI grader)
Goal: Beat every competitor. Make judges say "this is not a hackathon project, this is a real product."
======================================================================


----------------------------------------------------------------------
TIER 1: HIGH IMPACT — Build These First
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. INTERACTIVE CHARTS (Port from LuBot — Plotly)
   - 4th agent: "Chart Agent" card animates while picking visualization
   - Auto-pick chart type based on result shape:
     * Categorical + numeric → bar chart
     * Time series → line chart
     * Two categories + numeric → heatmap
     * Parts of whole → pie chart
     * Two numerics → scatter plot
   - Interactive Plotly.js (hover tooltips, zoom, pan, download PNG)
   - LuBot already has this in adalflow_agent.py — port the logic
   - Renders inline below the results table
   - Priority: #1 (biggest visual wow factor)
   - Estimate: 1 day

2. VISUAL SCHEMA MAP (New — Even LuBot doesn't have this)
   - When 2+ files uploaded, show an interactive diagram:
     * Files as nodes (boxes with file name + column list)
     * Detected join keys as edges between nodes
     * Confidence percentage on each edge
     * Color-coded: green = high confidence, yellow = fuzzy match
   - Library: React Flow (lightweight, drag-and-drop nodes)
   - Appears above the chat when user has 2+ files
   - Clicking a join key highlights it in both files
   - THIS IS THE "MERGE" IN MERGEAI — makes the product name literal
   - Priority: #2 (unique, visually striking, no competitor will have this)
   - Estimate: 1 day

3. AI-SUGGESTED QUESTIONS (After Upload)
   - After CSV upload, Schema Agent analyzes columns + sample values
   - Generates 5 smart questions specific to THIS data:
     * "Your data has Salary + Department + Gender — try: Compare salary by gender across departments"
     * "You have dates — try: Show training cost trend over time"
   - Replaces generic example chips with data-specific suggestions
   - Clickable — runs the query immediately
   - Priority: #3 (zero-friction onboarding, shows AI understanding)
   - Estimate: 0.5 day


----------------------------------------------------------------------
TIER 2: MEDIUM IMPACT — Build If Time Allows
----------------------------------------------------------------------

4. DATA PREVIEW (Port from LuBot)
   - Click any file in sidebar → modal/panel shows first 10 rows
   - Column headers with data types (text, number, date)
   - Row count, null percentage per column
   - Mini sparklines for numeric columns (optional)
   - LuBot has this — port the concept to Next.js
   - Priority: #4
   - Estimate: 0.5 day

5. EXPORT RESULTS AS PDF
   - "Download PDF" button on results
   - PDF includes: question, SQL query, chart image, data table, summary
   - Library: jsPDF + html2canvas (render the results div to PDF)
   - Branded: MergeAI logo + timestamp + page numbers
   - Looks like a professional analytics report
   - Priority: #5
   - Estimate: 0.5 day

6. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS (Conversational Context)
   - After a query, user can ask "now filter to just Engineering"
     or "break that down by gender" without repeating full question
   - Send previous question + SQL + results as context to agents
   - SQL Agent modifies the previous query instead of starting from scratch
   - LuBot has this pattern — port the conversation threading
   - Priority: #6
   - Estimate: 1 day

7. CHAT HISTORY (Multiple Sessions)
   - Left sidebar section: "Recent Queries" with timestamps
   - Click any past query → re-loads the result (table + chart + SQL)
   - Stored in localStorage (no DB needed for hackathon)
   - Or: Neon table for persistent history across devices
   - Shows the app is stateful, like a real product
   - Priority: #7
   - Estimate: 0.5 day


----------------------------------------------------------------------
TIER 3: POLISH & DIFFERENTIATION — Cherry Pick
----------------------------------------------------------------------

8. INSTANT DATA PROFILING ON UPLOAD
   - The moment CSV is uploaded, auto-generate a profile card:
     * Row count, column count
     * Data types per column
     * Null % per column (color-coded: green <5%, yellow <20%, red >20%)
     * Min/max/mean for numerics
     * Top 5 values for categoricals
     * Distribution sparklines
   - Shows immediately — no query needed
   - Proves technical depth to judges
   - Estimate: 0.5 day

9. CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT REASONING PANEL
   - Expandable side panel showing agent reasoning live:
     * Schema Agent: "Found join key: Department in file A ↔ Dept in file B (82% confidence)"
     * SQL Agent: "Using CTE approach for 2-file cross join..."
     * Validator: "42 rows returned, 0% nulls — PASS"
   - Already have agent events via SSE — just need richer UI
   - Proves AI is not a black box
   - Estimate: 0.5 day

10. CONFIDENCE SCORE ON RESULTS
    - Badge on results: "High Confidence" / "Medium" / "Low"
    - Based on: join key confidence + row count + null % + rounds needed
    - Green/yellow/red visual indicator
    - Small effort, big credibility signal
    - Estimate: 0.25 day

11. ANOMALY DETECTION ALERTS
    - After query results, auto-flag outliers:
      * "Warning: Engineering avg salary ($142K) is 3.2x higher than HR ($44K)"
      * "Outlier: One training program costs $50K (4.7 std dev from mean)"
    - Proactive intelligence — AI finds things you didn't ask about
    - Estimate: 0.5 day

12. SHAREABLE RESULTS LINK
    - "Share" button → generates a public URL with results snapshot
    - URL contains: chart + table + SQL + summary (read-only)
    - Judges can share with each other during judging
    - Implementation: Store result as JSON in Neon, serve via /share/[id]
    - Estimate: 0.5 day

13. COMPUTED COLUMNS VIA NATURAL LANGUAGE
    - "Add a column called profit that's revenue minus cost"
    - Agent adds a virtual computed column to the SQL (CTE alias)
    - Original file unchanged — column exists only in query context
    - Shows AI can transform data, not just query it
    - Estimate: 0.5 day

14. MULTI-FILE DRAG & DROP
    - Drop 3+ CSVs at once
    - Auto-detect all pairwise relationships
    - Show schema map with all connections
    - One action → full multi-file analysis ready
    - Estimate: 0.25 day

15. AI-POWERED DATA CLEANING SUGGESTIONS
    - On upload, detect and suggest fixes:
      * "Column 'date' has mixed formats (MM/DD/YYYY and YYYY-MM-DD) — standardize?"
      * "Column 'state' has 'CA', 'California', 'ca' — normalize?"
    - One-click fix applies transformation
    - Shows product handles real-world messy data
    - Estimate: 1 day

16. "EXPLAIN THIS" BUTTON
    - On any result, one click → AI explains in business terms:
      * "Engineering department spends 23% more on training than average,
        but also has the highest salary. This could indicate..."
    - Different from summary (which describes the data) — this INTERPRETS it
    - Estimate: 0.25 day


----------------------------------------------------------------------
INNOVATIVE IDEAS — NO OTHER HACKATHON PROJECT WILL HAVE THESE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A. "MERGE INTELLIGENCE" — Auto-Discovery Engine
   When you upload multiple files, MergeAI doesn't just detect joins —
   it auto-runs 3-5 cross-file queries and shows a "Discovery Dashboard"
   with the most interesting findings BEFORE you even ask a question.
   Upload 2 files → instantly see "Top 3 insights we found across your data."
   NO OTHER TOOL DOES THIS AUTOMATICALLY.

B. NATURAL LANGUAGE CHART CUSTOMIZATION
   "Make that a horizontal bar chart with blue bars"
   "Add a trend line to the scatter plot"
   "Change the title to 'Q4 Revenue by Region'"
   The Chart Agent understands NL requests to modify the visualization.
   Even LuBot doesn't do this.

C. DATA STORY MODE
   Click "Tell Me a Story" → MergeAI runs 5 queries automatically,
   builds a narrative with charts and insights, and presents a full
   analytics report like a data analyst would. One click → full report.
   This is what Hex Threads does but nobody in a hackathon will build it.

D. VOICE QUERIES
   "Hey MergeAI, what's the average salary by department?"
   Browser Web Speech API → text → agent pipeline.
   Microphone button in the input bar. LuBot has voice too — port it.
   Visually impressive for a live demo.

E. COMPARISON MODE
   Upload same-structure files from different time periods.
   "Compare Q1 vs Q2 sales" → side-by-side charts with delta highlights.
   Auto-detect that files have same columns but different data.
