🚀 48-Hour Vibe Coding Hackathon — Project Details
Date: February 21–23, 2026 Format: Solo or Team (max 3 members) Theme: Build a Real SaaS Product in 48 Hours

🎯 Overview
Welcome to the Vibe Coding Hackathon! Your challenge is to design, build, and ship a fully functional SaaS (Software as a Service) product using Next.js within 48 hours. This is your chance to turn an idea into something real — a product people could actually pay for.

Think about a real problem you or someone you know faces. Build a clean, polished solution. Ship it.
